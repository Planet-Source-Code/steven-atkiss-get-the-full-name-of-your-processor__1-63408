### Description

Get The Name Of Your Processor eg(AMD Athlon (tm)64 Processor 3000+) As You See It In The Control Panel-System Window. I Have Posted This Purely Because I couldn't Find The Code On PSC Any Where, Only Code That Gives You x86 N' Stuff Like That. I don't Know If It's Cheating But I Just Get It From The Registery.
 
### More Info
 
I've Only Tried This On Various Versions Of XP.
